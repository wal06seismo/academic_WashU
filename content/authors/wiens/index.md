Walid Ben-Mansour is a Postdoc Research Associate at Washington University in Saint Louis (Missouri), working in the Wiens Seismology Research Group . His research interests include seismic imaging of continental lithosphere and subduction zones (ambient noise, body and surface wave tomography, azimuthal anisotropy, Pn tomography) and multi-observable probabilistic tomography for different targets (mining, seismic hazard) to estimate the 3D thermochemical structure of the lithosphere.
