abstract: The thermochemical structure of the subcontinental mantle holds information on its origin and evolution that can inform energy and mineral exploration strategies, natural hazard mitigation and evolutionary models of Earth. However, imaging the fine-scale thermochemical structure of continental lithosphere remains a major challenge. Here we combine multiple land and satellite datasets via thermodynamically constrained inversions to obtain a high-resolution thermochemical model of central and southern Africa. Results reveal diverse structures and compositions for cratons, indicating distinct evolutions and responses to geodynamic processes. While much of the Kaapvaal lithosphere retained its cratonic features, the western Angolan–Kasai Shield and the Rehoboth Block have lost their cratonic keels. The lithosphere of the Congo Craton has been affected by metasomatism, increasing its density and inducing its conspicuous low-topography, geoid and magnetic anomalies. Our results reconcile mantle structure with the causes and location of volcanism within and around the Tanzanian Craton, whereas the absence of volcanism towards the north is due to local asthenospheric downwellings, not to a previously proposed lithospheric root connecting with the Congo Craton. Our study offers improved integration of mantle structure, magmatism and the evolution and destruction of cratonic lithosphere, and lays the groundwork for future lithospheric evolutionary models and exploration frameworks for Earth and other terrestrial planets.

abstract: The presence of high mountains along passive margins is not unusual, as shown by their presence in several regions (Scandinavia, Greenland, East US, SW Africa, Brazil, West India and SE Australia). However, the origin of this topography is not well understood. The mountain range between the Scandinavian passive margin and the Fennoscandian shield is a good example. A simple Airy isostatic model would predict a compensating root beneath the mountains but existing seismic measurements of variations in crustal thickness do not provide evidence of a root of sufficient size to produce the necessary compensation. In order to better constrain the physical properties of the crust in northern Scandinavia, two broad-band seismic networks were deployed between 2007 and 2009 and between 2013 and 2014. A new map of crustal thickness has been produced from P-receiver function analysis of teleseismic data recorded at 31 seismic stations. The map shows an increase in crustal thickness from the Atlantic coast (38.7 ± 1.8  km) to the Gulf of Bothnia (43.5 ± 2.4  km). This gradient in thickness demonstrates that the Moho topography does not mirror the variation in surface topography in this region. Thus, classical Airy isostatic models cannot explain how the surface topography is supported. New maps showing variation in Poisson’s ratio and Moho sharpness together with forward and inverse modelling provide new information about the contrasting properties of the Fennoscandian shield and crust reworked by the Caledonian orogeny. A sharp Moho transition (R > 1) and low value of Vs (3.5 ± 0.2  km s−1) are observed beneath the orogen. The shield is characterized by a gradual transition across the Moho (R < 1) and Vs of 3.8 ± 0.1  km s−1 which is more typical of average continental crust. These observations are explained by a Fennoscandian shield underplated with a thick layer of high velocity, high density material. It is proposed that this layer has been removed or reworked beneath the orogen..
