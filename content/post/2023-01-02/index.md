Our book "Structure and evolution of Laurussian orogens in Europe and North America from geophysical investigations" has been approved for publication in  Special Publication series. The submission and review processes will start in the next weeks.

Aims of the book: 
During the Paleozoic, two main tectonic collisions reshaped the surface topography and lithosphere in large areas of what we name Europe and North America, leading to the assembly of Laurussia (~550-250 Myrs). The first one formed the early Palaeozoic Caledonides, located today along the present-day North Atlantic passive margins of Scandinavia, the British Isles and Greenland. The remnants of the late Palaeozoic Variscan orogen covers large parts of central and southern Europe. In North America, the two orogenic phases called the Acadian and Alleghenian orogenies overlapped spatially, and now form the present-day Appalachian Mountains. The post-orogenic evolution of these orogenies appears to be vastly different. While continental breakup roughly followed the trend of the Caledonian and Appalachian structures, the Variscides did not experience continental breakup. Instead, Central Europe experienced a long phase of intraplate magmatism from the Carboniferous to Cenozoic, which was likely related to a major modification of structure and physical properties of the lithosphere.

Recent geophysical studies and increased multi-disciplinary approaches integrating geology, geochemical and geophysical information provided new insights into the 3D architecture and physical state of the lithosphere of these orogenies. The proposed special volume will present the state of the art in the field. The special publication will give an opportunity collect, summarize and review the latest geophysical studies of the lithosphere in these orogens. The special publication will not only enable a comparison between different geophysical methods in the same areas, but also a between the lithospheric structures of the respective orogens. The book concludes in a summary and synthesis of the contributions, trying to identify advantages and limitations of current models but also highlight areas that require further investigations.

With this book, we do not simply want to conduct a study on how different geophysical methods agree - but to bring together the community that images the Paleozoic orogens and give future research projects a good basis of ideas on how research questions can be tackled.

An introduction presenting the state-of-the art of the Laurussian orogens in Europe and North America will be followed by approx. 16 papers subdivided into 3 sections according to orogenic domains (Caledonides, Acadian-Variscan North America, Variscan Europe) and 7 papers focussing on the comparison between different geophysical methods and orogens.
