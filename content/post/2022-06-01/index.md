Our NSF proposal "Thermal and Compositional Structure of Antarctica from Probabilistic Joint Inversion of Seismic, Gravity, and Topography Data and Petrological Modelling" has been approved by the Office of Polar Programs for the period 07/2022-06/2024.

Non-Technical abstract:

The physical state of the mantle beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet plays a key role in the interaction between the Antarctic ice cover and the solid earth, strongly influencing the glacial system's evolution. Generally, mantle temperature profiles are determined by analyzing rock samples from the mantle to determine pressure-temperature conditions, and/or by conversion of seismic velocity anomalies to temperature anomalies. However, mantle rocks have been found only in a very few places in Antarctica, and seismic anomalies reflect not only thermal anomalies but also compositional variations. In this project, the investigators will (1) use the most recent geophysical datasets sensitive to temperature and composition (high-resolution seismic velocity model, topography, satellite gravity), (2) Combine the sensitivity of these datasets in a to retrieve the most reliable model of thermal and compositional structure, (3) translate the results into 2-dimensional maps of temperature slices and the composition of iron in the mantle,(4) compare the results with results from other continents to better understand Antarctic geological history, and (5) use the new thermal model along with established rock relationships to estimate mantle viscosity. aledonides, Acadian-Variscan North America, Variscan Europe) and 7 papers focussing on the comparison between different geophysical methods and orogens.
